This is a class project from CSCI 235.
It uses lists and a stack to find a route from your origin to destination.
To read a "map" you would run the readmap function.
It will then take the map and read every city in it and create a node in a list for each city.
If you look at the sample_map, the top line is for cities that exist. 
The second line is for cities you can visit from the origin. So left is origin, right is city you can go to.
